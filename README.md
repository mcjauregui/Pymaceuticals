# Pymaceuticals
Pymaceuticals, Inc., is a pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Pymaceuticals recently began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

In its most recent animal study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
